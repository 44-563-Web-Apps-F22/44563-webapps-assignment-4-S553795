<h6> Patience in the Palace of Barataria</h6>
<h6>SCENE.— Exterior of Castle Bunthorne, the gateway to which is
            seen, R.U.E., and is approached by a drawbridge over a moat.
            A rocky eminence R. with steps down to the stage.  In front
            of it, a rustic bench, on which ANGELA is seated, with ELLA
            on her left.  Young Ladies wearing aesthetic draperies are
            grouped about the stage from R. to L.C., SAPHIR being near
            the L. end of the group.  The Ladies play on lutes, etc., as
            they sing, and all are in the last stage of despair.]
            No. 1. Twenty love-sick maidens we
           (Opening Chorus and Solos)
             Maidens, Angela, and Ella </p>
      <p>
          ELLA  The love of maidens is, to him, as interesting as thetaxes!
          SAPHIR  Would that it were!  He pays his taxes.
          ANGELA  And cherishes the receipts!
          [Enter LADY JANE, L.U.E.]
           SAPHIR  Happy receipts!  [All sigh heavily]
           JANE [L.C., suddenly] Fools!  [They start, and turn to her]
           ANGELA  I beg your pardon?
           JANE  Fools and blind!  The man loves — wildly loves!
           ANGELA  But whom?  None of us!
           PATIENCE [stopping her as she turns to go up C.]  But stay, I
           have some news for you.  The 35th Dragoon Guards have halted in
           the village, and are even now on their way to this very spot.
           ANGELA  The 35th Dragoon Guards!
           PATIENCE  But, bless me, you were all engaged to them a year ago!
           SAPHIR  They are fleshly men, of full habit!
           ELLA  We care nothing for Dragoon Guards!
           PATIENCE  But, bless me, you were all engaged to them a year ago!
           SAPHIR  A year ago!

          <h6 class="don"> DON AL.</h6>  <p class="speech">Good evening.  Fancy ball?</p>
             <h6 class="giu">GIU.</h6>  <p class="speech">No, not exactly.  A little friendly dance.  That's</p>
        all.  Sorry you're late.
             <h6 class="don">DON AL.</h6>  <p class="speech">But I saw a groom dancing, and a footman!</p>
             <h6 class="mar">MAR.</h6>  <p class="speech">Yes.  That's the Lord High Footman.</p>
             <h6 class="don">DON AL.</h6>  <p class="speech">And, dear me, a common little drummer boy!</p>
             <h6 class="giu">GIU.</h6>  <p class="speech">Oh no!  That's the Lord High Drummer Boy.</p>
             <h6 class="don">DON AL.</h6>  <p class="speech">But surely, surely the servants'-hall is the place
        for these gentry? </p>
             <h6 class="giu">GIU.</h6>  <p class="speech">Oh dear no!  We have appropriated the servants'-hall.
        It's the Royal Apartment, and accessible only by tickets 
        obtainable at the Lord Chamberlain's office.</p>
             <h6 class="mar">MAR.</h6>  <p class="speech">We really must have some place that we can call our
        own.</p>
